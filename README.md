# CUDATutorial
A CUDA tutorial to make people learn CUDA program from 0

## test enviroment
Turing T4 GPU

## remark
* related performance data is attached at the top of code file.
* the performance data is diverse and diverse on different GPU platforms and NVCC compiler, so some counter-intuitive result is normal, we should only explore and debug the result.
* welcome all comments and pull requests.

## update notes
### v2.0
* add cuda stream
* add quantize
### v2.1
* add fp32/fp16 gemv
